## Part A: existing technology
* thermal modifiers
  * alters the properties of wood to let it better resist moisture, decay, and pests.
* lathe
  * spins wood so you can use different tools to cut pieces off and mold it into whatever shape or object youd like.
* saw tables
  * a circular blade sticking out of the middle of a table, you push the wood into it and it cuts while you push, used for making precise and straight cuts on wood.
* ai quality control
  *used to moniter the quality of wood, allowing seperation between the wood being used to make sure you're using high quality wood for high quality furniture or other objects.
* drills
  * used to make holes in the wood so you can insert wood or screws, along with other things, to attatch different pieces together, as well as hang things.

## Part B: possible future technology
* ai functioned tree cutter
  * an ai that is built in to a machine on wheels that uses a scanner or sonar technology to find the trees in the area and drive towards them, the front of the machine will have large saws to cut the tree, and the tree would fall backwards onto the bed of the machine, where there will be pressure enabled clamps to hold the tree down while it continues to drive. once the bed is full, it will go to a designated area and tilt the bed to drop the logs into a convenient spot.
*catcher
  *one of the main dangers is a tree falling on people, so if you have something to catch it, it will not hit anyone.
  *slowly lowers tree to the ground after catching it.
  *human controlled.
