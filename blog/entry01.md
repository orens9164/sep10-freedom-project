# Entry 1: finding my topic (lumber)
##### 11/21/25

## Choosing a topic

after a bit of searching i decided to focus on lumber since ive always wanted to do something that had to do with nature. I did some research and found out there was a lot more to lumber than i originally thought. I used to think of lumber as just cutting down trees and then cutting off sections to make things out of. Turns out, theres a lot more steps than that, such as polishing and figuring out the quality. i mostly used google to find all the steps, I didn't really use any specific websites, but seeing all of this made me sure about what topic I would choose.

## Engineering Design Process

for the first stage of the engineering design process, i decided to think about how the wood is used. the next step is to research about existing technology to find out what people have already created.

## Skills

some skills I learned form doing thius blog is time management, how best to research, and the importance of doing work on time.

### Time management

i have several things to do outside of school, such as bowling, and an internship at the brooklyn public library, so sometimes its difficult to find the time to do my work. ive learned that its importatnt to have a set schedule in the day so that you can make sure to get everything done.

### How to research

in my opinion, the best way to research is to use google to find ai overviews, as well as small snippets from reliable websites that google provides without actually clicking onto the websites. it also depends on what you put into google, its better to use specific parts of your topic, for me that would be something like "how is the wood from trees used to make things."

### importance of doing work on time

the main thing I learned here is that if you don't do your work on time, it starts to stack up, and then you have multiple things missing and have to do them all in a set amount of time if you want to do well. 

## Next steps

the next step for me is to start researching technology that already exists for my topic and compiling it into my content.md page.
