# Entry 2: researching existing technology
##### 11/22/25

## Researching technology

I did a lot of searching on google and found some technology that already exists that shows how the wood is used and different steps to ensure its quality. theres things like ai that can detect the quality of wood and seperate it, and thermal technology to help with moisture and decay. i only used google for my research, with key words such as "quality".

## Engineering Design Process

I've done my research of existing technology, so the nest step will be to think of possibilities for new technology for the future.

## Skills

the main skills ive learned from this blog are using key words when searching, and how best to commpile data.

### Using key words

its best to use key words when searching so google knows what specific subject your searching for. for instance, searching "best cat breed" is a lot more vague because theres different opinions, its better to search something like "calmest cat breed."

### Compiling data

its best to put a lot of data inside of different bullet points or sections so you know exactly where evrything is. this can be very helpful later on when your looking for the data again. 

## Next steps

since im done researching, the next step is going to be brainstorming different ideas for future technology.
